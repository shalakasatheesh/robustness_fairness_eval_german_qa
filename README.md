# Evaluation of Robustness and Fairness for the Task of German Question Answering

Currently contains 3 packages:

1. `qa_inference`: To carry out inference with a given dataset and compute F1 and EM scores
2. `qa_data_perturb`: To perturb a given dataset
3. `embedding`: To get token or sentence embedding of a given sentence.

Also contains two Jupyter notebooks for:

1. Generating the German subset of the BBQ dataset 
2. Calculating the Bias Score
